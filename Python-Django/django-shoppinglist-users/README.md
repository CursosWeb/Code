# Shopping list (users)

Very simple shopping list web application.
Uses a dictionary to store items and quantities to shop.
Since the dictionary is not persistent, the shopping list
is empty every time the application is reloaded.

This version includes very basic support for users:
login via the admin app, logout, and current user in the top of
each page.

To run (with Django installed):

```bash
% ./manage.py runserver
```
